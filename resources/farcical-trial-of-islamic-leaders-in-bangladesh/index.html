<p><strong>Farcical Trial of Islamic leaders in Bangladesh</strong></p>
<p><strong>HRDB Report</strong></p>
<p>With the arrest of Professor Golam Azam, the former Ameer of Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami (BJI) and a leading Islamic thinker on January 11, 2012, for his alleged crimes against humanity during the liberation war of Bangladesh, the number of arrested leaders of Jamaat and Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) stood at 8. Of the arrested, 6 are from Jamaat and 2 from BNP. The arrested Jamaat leaders include its Ameer, also a former minister  Moulana Motiur Rahman Nizami, Nayebe-e-Ameer former member of parliament Moulana Delwar Hossain Sayedee, Secretary General former minister Ali Ahsan Muhammad Mujahid, two secretaries general Muhammad Kamaruzzamn and Abdul Quader Mollah. The two arrested BNP leaders are former ministers Abdul Aleem and Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury.</p>
<p>The International Crimes Tribunal, which has been constituted after 40 years of independence when the present Awami League government assumed power in January 2009 made it clear that in order to alienate Jamaat from BNP and perpetuate state power, they would crash Jamaat at any cost as it has become a balancing force and helped BNP in forming government twice since 1991. The International Crimes Act of 1973, which was framed to try 195 identified Pakistani war criminals, is now being used in trying mainly the top Jamaat leaders accusing them for the atrocities committed in 1971 after amending the law. Jamaat from the very beginning has been denying allegations relating to committing any crimes saying that Jamaat’s role in 1971 was to support the integrity of a united Pakistan as it feared an Indian aggression. The government of Pakistan had formed the auxiliary forces involving the Bengali elements and Jamaat had nothing to do with those forces.</p>
<p>International Lawyers Association, Bangladesh Supreme Court Bar Association, human rights organizations like London based Amnesty International and New York-based Human Rights Watch, US Ambassador-at-Large Stephen J Rapp on War Crimes Affairs identified many flaws of the International Crimes Tribunal of 1973 and made a number of recommendations to amend the law if the government really want to carry out the trial and make it transparent and acceptable to the international community maintaining international standard. Human Rights Watch have urged the Bangladesh government to ensure defendants receive fair trials by clarifying the definition of charges and allowing the accused to question the tribunal’s impartiality — currently not allowed under Bangldeshi law. But the government without implementing the recommendations has started trial taking into cognizance the imaginary charges against the arrested Jamaat leaders.</p>
<p>Leaders and supporters of both Jamaat and BNP termed the accusations of committing war time atrocities against their leaders are politically motivated and aiming at eliminating the opposition. The government is carrying out its politics of vendetta making the respectable leaders as easy prey. Because the Prime Minister of the present government Sheikh Hasina, daughter of the founder of Bangladesh considers the defendants as her bitter political enemies.</p>
<p>Professor Golam Azam, aged 89 retired from politics in 2000, has been summoned by the International Crimes Tribunal through his lawyer to appear before the tribunal and arrived on January 11 in a wheelchair. His lawyer sought bail citing his health complications. But denying the bail petition the tribunal ordered to send him to jail. Though by the same tribunal, former BNP minister Abdul Alim had been freed on conditional bail because of his poor health.  Former chief appeared before the tribunal in line with a previous order and entered the tribunal on a wheel chair.  In the petition, Ghulam Azam’s family said he is suffering from different old age complexities. The law related to the trial of crimes against humanity does not allow the defense to challenge the ruling in a higher court during the trial process. It only allows any person convicted for such crimes will be able to appeal the final verdict of the tribunal in the Supreme Court.</p>
<p><strong>Who is</strong><strong> </strong><strong> Ghulam Azam</strong></p>
<p>Ghulam Azam, a prominent writer, thinker, and internationally renowned Islamic scholar, who led Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami for nearly 30 years until his retirement in 2001. Despite a High Court judgement in 1993, which totally exonerated Prof. Azam from any crimes in 1971, the tribunal has appealed to the government for his arrest based on false allegation and witnesses. He has consistently denied these accusations. He campaigned for Pakistan to remain united as one Islamic nation, but denies any involvement in the crimes committed by the Pakistani army and other forces. In recent interviews, he spoke about his role and his protests against army atrocities and how these protests were never allowed to be published in newspapers due to censorship.</p>
<p>At the age of 89, he has been made the subject of a campaign of propaganda and misinformation, after having been active in politics for many years before and after the independence war. There are concerns for his welfare if he is placed under arrest as well as the legality and impartiality of the outcome of a trial under the circumstances. Ghulam Azam had recorded setting a unique example in political culture of Bangladesh by stepping down voluntarily from the highest post of his party over a decade ago which was admired in home and abroad.</p>
<p><strong>Fact about war crime charges against Azam</strong></p>
<p>War crime charges have been brought against Azam in a politically hostile environment that has pre-determined their fate. These trials are to commence in a Tribunal that has yet to rectify its legislative difficulties in relation to:</p>
<p>Lack of elements of crimes; Complete absence of criminal evidential rules; Complete absence of criminal procedural rules; Total disregard of international norms; and Removal of constitutional rights and widespread abandonment of fundamental protections.</p>
<p>There are also a number of procedural issues that will prejudice fair trial standards and any outcome of the cases. These include, <em>inter alia: </em>The lack of protection for defense witnesses; The coaching of Prosecution witnesses apparent in trial proceedings in the case; against Delowar Hossain Sayedee; and Omission of recording of proceedings.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.savebd.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/GhulamAzam_sick.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-231" title="GhulamAzam_sick" src="http://www.savebd.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/GhulamAzam_sick.jpg" alt="" width="280" height="179" /></a><strong>Stand of the international Community regarding the so-called war crime tribunal</strong></p>
<p>The international community continues to voice its criticism of the Tribunal. Most recently the United States Ambassador-at-large for War Crimes Issues, Stephen J. Rapp, voiced his concern that a number of his recommendations in relation to the Tribunal were not implemented and stated that “much [could] still be accomplished to ensure that justice is done and is seen to be done in these historic proceedings”.</p>
<p>The manner in which the current trial is proceeding against the first defendant, Delwar Hossain Sayedee, provides a clear exemplification of the intent of the Government. The charges are poorly drafted and ill-defined, the defense is prevented from adequately challenging the case put forward and the conduct of the prosecution is nothing short of contempt for a proper judicial process. The Tribunal cannot be allowed to continue in its political war against Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami on instruction from the present day Awami League Government.</p>
