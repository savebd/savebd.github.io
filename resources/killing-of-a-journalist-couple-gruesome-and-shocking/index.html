<p><strong>HRDB Report</strong></p>
<p>The gory killing of a journalist couple has sent shockwaves throughout the city and beyond. We are at a loss for words. One&#8217;s senses are benumbed by the sheer brutality of the incident. The loss to the kin as well as to the profession is irreparable and we can only offer our deepest condolences to the family members of the deceased couple and hope that they would be able to find courage to overcome their grief.</p>
<p>The killings expose how dehumanized the society has become. And the matter is made doubly painful because the killers not only cut short the lives of a young couple and left a 5-year old orphan they have also caused the brutally premature end to two very promising journalists. Known to be friendly and affable in disposition, their loss is all the more grievious.</p>
<p>It is a sad day for journalists. And although it is too early to say the killings had any connection to the calling of the unfortunate couple, to our understanding, it is nonetheless a fact that journalists have become increasingly vulnerable and their life is being constantly put on the line in the performance of their professional duty.</p>
<p>We call for urgent solution of the murder case and apprehension of the killers, and in this regard we welcome the directives of the prime minister to nab the culprits immediately. However, we would like to emphasise on several things here. The outpourings of sentiments from people in authority are natural and we would only hope that the flurry of activities, orders and instruction emanating from various official quarters will be carried through and will not peter out after the dusts settle. For that has been the experience with several cases of murder, where the culprits are yet to be apprehended. That city dwellers in particular have a growing sense of insecurity from the unsolved murder cases and lack of conviction should prompt the government into some energetic and visible action on the law and order front.</p>
<p>We feel that the matter is a test case for the police and we would like to remind the people in position of responsibility not to make callow remarks, like ordering the police to apprehend the culprits in 48 hours, which detracts the sensitivity of a most unfortunate incident.</p>
<h1>PM’s words on Sagor-Runi murder disappointing</h1>
<p>The assertion of the prime minister, during her address to grassroots leaders of the ruling Awami League at Ganabhaban in the capital Dhaka just a few days after the murder of journalist couple Sagor Sarwar and Meherun Runi that the government could not ensure security in people’s bedrooms is both disappointing and disquieting.</p>
<p>The statement is disappointing because it essentially dampens public expectations of an expeditious investigation of the gruesome murder of Maasranga news editor Sagar Sarwar and his wife, senior ATN Bangla reporter Meherun Runi, and thus identification and prosecution of, and punishment for, the killers. It is all the more so because, within a few hours after Sarowar and Runi were found stabbed to death in their West Rajabazar residence on February 11, the home minister ordered the police to arrest the killers within 48 hours and subsequently informed the press that the prime minister herself was monitoring progress of the investigation.</p>
<p>The prime minister’s assertion is disquieting since it tends to suggest that the government may be trying to shirk its responsibility as far as effective and efficient investigation of the case is concerned. According to a report in the New Age, she both lamented the ‘irresponsible attitude’ of journalists in reporting the murders and castigated them for having rushed to the victims’ residence in droves and, in the process, destroyed evidence. While her observation about ‘irresponsible’ reporting may be partially true, her claim that the presence of a large number of journalists at the crime scene destroyed evidence appears geared towards attempts at protecting the police from criticism for their obvious inefficiency. It was only natural for the journalists to rush to the crime scene; for, on the one hand, it was on the one hand their professional obligation and on the other the victims were members of the journalist community. If important evidence has indeed been destroyed, it is the police that are to blame; after all, it was their responsibility to make the crime spot off-limits to the general public, journalists included.</p>
<p>The prime minister’s claim that the government cannot ensure security in people’s bedrooms is also loaded with far-reaching implications on the ongoing investigation and beyond. While the investigators have so indicated involvement of outsiders in the twin murders, the prime minister’s words seems to suggest that the killings could have been a result of marital dispute gone awry and that the victims may have actually killed each other. Such suggestion, especially when coming from the prime minister herself, could very influence, if not change the course of, investigation. Furthermore, questions may very well arise what the necessity of the government is if it cannot prevent killing of people in the supposedly safe and comfortable confines of their own bedrooms. What’s more, criminals may feel encouraged to break into people’s residences and kill them, assured that the government will not take responsibility for breach in security of the victims’ residence.</p>
<p>Overall, with one masterstroke, the prime minister seems to have highlighted her government’s indifference towards public concern, dampened public expectations of expeditious investigation of the twin murders and exemplary punishment for the killers of Sarowar and Runi, provided a pretext for the police to blame their failure on, and emboldened criminals. The prime minister needs to revisit her statement and weigh its implications; it should make her realise how disappointing her words and how disquieting their implications could be for the people at large. Most importantly, she needs to realise that the popular expectations have been heightened since the home minister told reporters that she was personally monitoring the progress of the investigation of the double murder. The only way that she can live up to such expectations is by ensuring that the killers are identified, arrested, prosecuted and punished — sooner than later.</p>
