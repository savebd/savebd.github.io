<p><strong>HRDB Report</strong></p>
<p>Not having a mobile phone, torchlight and a thousand rupees as bribe almost cost the life of a Bangladeshi who was caught on camera while being tortured by Indian border guards. Stripping him, the jawans of Border Security Force (BSF) tied his hands and legs and beat him up before dumping his unconscious body in a mustard field near Raninagar camp in Murshidabad district in the Indian state of Paschimbanga.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I opened my eyes, I was not sure if I was alive. I rested in the mustard field for a while to pull myself together. Though I was unable to move due to the excessive beating, I forced myself to get up and headed towards home,&#8221; the victim said. He estimated that he was about five to seven kilometres into the Indian Territory.</p>
<p>Habibur Rahman, 22, son of one Saidur Rahman of Sateroroshia village under Shibganj upazila of Chapainawabganj, used to smuggle cattle from India. He had never been caught by the BSF in his one-year stint as a smuggler until December 9 last year, the day he experienced his worst nightmare.</p>
<p>The video footage of the BSF torture that had been aired by different television channels in India, including NDTV, sent a shock wave across the nation. Later Habib was identified and interviewed by the national media. It was known from him that on December 9 morning 2011, 10-12 men, including Habibur, sneaked into Murshidabad district through Khanpur border in Paba upazila of Rajshahi to fetch some cattle as instructed by a Bangladeshi trader.</p>
<p>&#8220;We found no cattle when we reached the rendezvous point. So, we started back for home,&#8221; said Habibur, adding that it was around 11:00pm when the BSF men caught him with two others. &#8220;They demanded Rs 1,000, a mobile phone and torchlight from me. As I said I did not have those, they started kicking and punching me. But that was only the trailer of what to happen next. They took me to their camp at Raninagar on a tractor,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The real beating began the next morning,&#8221; said Habibur, &#8220;Two jawans stripped me, tied my hands at the back to a stick. They also tied the legs. Then they started to beat me up with a stick.&#8221; Habibur still looked in shock when he was describing the BSF brutality. &#8220;As I fell on the ground, three of them indulged in beating me up indiscriminately,&#8221; said Habibur failing to hold his tears. The video footage of the Indian TV channels and on website matches the description of the victim.</p>
<p>&#8220;At one point, one of them sat on my abdomen and held my feet up while another hit me on the bare sole with a stick. The torture continued for at least an hour,&#8221; he said, adding that the jawans then dragged him a few yards, pulled him up and asked him to walk on his own. &#8220;But I blacked out and fell down. A few hours later, I found myself lying in a mustard field,&#8221; the victim said. He showed his injuries marks on the face, hands, legs and the back.</p>
<p>On his return, Habibur did not dare to go to a hospital fearing more ordeals. He chose traditional treatment. About his former profession, Habibur said each cattle smuggler get Tk 1,000 for bringing a pair of cattle and one could bring up to six cows in each trip. Pointing out that chances are high for cattle smugglers to get caught, he said BSF men let them go in exchange bribes.</p>
<p>After reports were published in different newspapers and television channels, BGB officials also met the victim. “We tracked him at his home in Sateroroshia village,” Lt Col Jahangir Hossain, commanding officer of 39 BGB Battalion in Chapainawabganj, told the journalists.</p>
<p><strong>Dhaka protests at BSF torture</strong></p>
<p>Bangladesh has protested the inhuman torture by the Indian Border Security Force on one of its nationals and expressed its ‘utter dismay’ to the Indian side at such atrocities. The foreign affairs ministry in a statement said Dhaka had conveyed its resentment to Delhi for the abusive and violent action of BSF personnel, despite repeated assurance from the Indian government of its border guards showing utmost restraint. The BSF torture took the centre-stage after the Indian electronic media on Wednesday telecast a video footage of the December 9, 2011 brutality, which was followed up by the media in Bangladesh.</p>
<p>A Bangladesh national was stripped and tortured by BSF personnel at Rajshahi border last month, said the statement. The video footage taken by a mobile phone showed BSF personnel mercilessly beating a Bangladeshi youth as he refused to pay them bribe.</p>
<p>The foreign ministry requested the Indian authorities to conduct a thorough enquiry into the incident and take appropriate action against the BSF personnel responsible for the incident. It also requested for taking immediate actions to prevent recurrence of such incidents in the future.</p>
<p>India, meanwhile, said that a full investigation has been ordered into the assault of a suspected Bangladeshi citizen by BSF personnel. ‘BSF has taken a prompt action of suspending the BSF Jawans involved in the incident and full investigations have been ordered into the matter,’ a spokesman of the external affairs ministry said responding to a question on the reported incident at the India-Bangladesh border involving the BSF troops.</p>
<p>It was known that Indian authority ordered a full investigation into the recent torture on a Bangladeshi by their Border Security Force men and the authorities of the paramilitary frontier force took ‘prompt actions’ in suspending the personnel concerned.</p>
<p>‘BSF has taken prompt action to suspend BSF jawans involved in the incident and full investigations have been ordered into the matter,’ a spokesman of the India’s external affairs ministry said in a brief comment as video footage of the torture posted online sparked wide reactions in Bangladeshi as well as Indian media.</p>
