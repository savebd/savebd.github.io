<p><strong>Badiur Rahman</strong></p>
<p>Forty years have passed since Bangladesh’s independence. Military rulers and political parties came to power with promises of establishing peace, progress, rule of law. But once in power they forget their commitments. `Peoples Republic of Bangladesh’ means ruled by the people, at least it is inscribed in the constitution. Unstable and chaotic politics, terrorism, corruption has hindered the progress of the country. Politics has been morally degenerated, terrorized. Bangladesh’s democracy is known as poor, imperfect and fragile.</p>
<p>To strengthen democracy there is no alternative to an effective parliament. Parliamentary system of government was introduced in 1991. Bangladesh got four elected governments since 1991. People of the country frequently witnessing the same government either led by Hasina or Khaleda. The main characteristics of Bangladesh politics are government and opposition never agree to each other. If BNP goes to right, Awami league will go to left. Out of the total working days in the last three years of the present parliament, leader of the opposition Khaleda Zia was present only for 6 days. Same was true in case of Sheikh Hasina during the 8th parliament when she was in the opposition.</p>
<p>Following the bad instances of the past government is the main impediment of the progress of Bangladesh. Present President Zillur Rahman had freed over 30 death sentence convicts during the last three years exercizing his power to clemency. All the freed convicts were activists of the ruling party.</p>
<p>The rise of anarchy in the country has increased following the brutal murder of Sheikh Mujib and President Zia. Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia were selected as the heads of the Awami League and the BNP as they were considered to be the symbol of unity ot the respective party. Both of them made their entry to politics as the inheritor respectively of their father and husband. The people expected that they would maintain the democratic values avobe personal and party interest. But they lost their credibility. Both of them are running their parties and government like autocrats.</p>
<p>The worst forms of human rights violations such as unlawful torture and killings were rampant during the so called democratic rule under the two main parties. Absence of democratic values and propensity for authoritarianism resulted in human rights abuses at different times. In recent years, human rights situation in Bangladesh has deteriorated to an alarming stage. People are concerned by the denial of the AL government and their inaction to prevent human rights violations. Most worrisome is the justification by some ministers and leading ruling party politicians of suppressing opposition political views.</p>
<p>During the BNP rule (2001-06), Awami League as the main opposition party criticized of extra-judicial killings by law enforcement agencies. Before 2008 elections, AL promised to stop such unlawful killings. Foreign Minister Dr Dipu Moni made commitments of ‘zero tolerance&#8217; regarding this type of killings in different international forums including the Human Rights Council and the Universal Periodic Review Session in Geneva. But these commitments were never fulfilled. Unlawful killings have been continuing. In Bangladesh inflicting different kinds of mental and physical torture is a routine procedure to extract information from the accused. In some cases, the victims simply ‘disappear&#8217;. The practice of custodial torture and unlawful killings started in the country during the first AL regime (1972-75) and has continued unabated till today. It reached a tragic stage during the army-led emergency regime (2007-2008), when hundreds of top political leaders and businessmen were mentally and physically tortured in detention and jailed after sham trials. More than 70,000 political workers at grass-root levels were thrown into prison without any concrete charges. Due process of law was denied to them.</p>
<p>The present government is democratic in name only, but it has narrowed down the space for political opposition by denying the rights of peaceful protests and public meetings. Thousands of criminal cases have been filed against opposition political leaders and workers. The national parliament has become a one-party show, a place for condemning the opposition for all failures of administration and governance.</p>
<p>In Bangladesh , freedom of thought and conscience, and of free speech deteriorated significantly. Attacks on journalists, the press, newspapers, television have been increased. Seven journalists were killed in last three years, the most recent incident was killings of a journalist couple in February 2012. Besides, 131 journalists were injured, 69 threatened, 43 assaulted and 30 attacked during the same period.  In April, 2010 , a leading television channel was shut down and permission of launching of another channel has been suspended . The photo-exhibition titled ‘Crossfire&#8217; was shut down in March, 2010.  The government of Bangladesh blocked access to social network Facebook in May, 2010 for uploading some satirical images of the Prime Minister and also for uploading the Enquiry Report on the BDR massacre. <em> </em>The private TV station ‘Banglavision&#8217; was forced to stop telecast a program on the life of a hangman. Media outlets ‘unfriendly&#8217; to the government are regularly threatened. The ruling party hooligans attacked the National Press Club after the pro-government candidates failed to win its elections in December 2011. The most recent act of controlling media was directives of government regulatory authority to the private TV channels for not telecast live the 12 March, 2012 grand rally of the opposition in Dhaka.</p>
<p>Judiciary has been formally separated from the executive, but yet to act independently. It is manipulated and controlled by the government. Filing of cases against Nobel Laureate and pioneer of microcredit organization and founder of Grameen Bank Dr. Muhammad Yunus on flimsy ground has been criticized even in international media. Cases were filed against some leading figures in Transparency International for reporting on the corrupt practices in various departments of the government including Judiciary. The investigative process and framing of charges are often influenced by government. Instances of appointing judges based on party loyalty, have resulted in lack of transparency and public confidence on judiciary.</p>
<p>Thousands of cases against the ruling party members (some of them facing serious charges of corruption and violent crimes) have been withdrawn by the government, while personal vendetta and jealousy are said to motivate Sheikh Hasina to use the state machineries to file dozens of cases against Dr. Yunus, Khaleda Zia, and hundreds of other opposition leaders and activists.</p>
<p>Government measures and legal system have failed very miserably to ensure justice for the poor and their children, for ethnic and religious minorities, for the workers in general, but women and child laborers in particular. Trade union rights of industrial workers are restricted. The last three years witnessed a sharp rise in incidents of harassment and physical abuse of young women and girls, by ruling party youths. Lack of accountability and acts of impunity persisted and prevented the redress of such violations.</p>
