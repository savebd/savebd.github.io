Dhaka stirs with Big Protests. Thousands of protesters marched in capital Dhaka on Thursday against Bangladesh parliament adopted an Islamic constitution, steering away from a secular political culture, which was enshrined in 1972 constitution.</p></div>
<p><strong>SaveBD  exclusive</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Over the last 3 years Bangladesh has witnessed a campaign against Islam that is unprecedented in its history. The Awami League government has launched a brutal crackdown on anyone and everyone who calls for an Islamic alternative to the current crisis faced by the country. This struggle has seen the abduction, arrest and torture of army officers, renowned professionals, academics and students and the banning of Islamic movements, the aim being to separate Islam from life&#8217;s affairs and to keep Bangladesh subservient to foreign powers.</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Background</strong><br />
Bangladesh is a country with a population of over 150 Million people, where more than 85% are Muslim. Allah (SWT) has blessed the country with many assets and resources such as a huge hard working population, fertile land, gas reserves of 20-80TCF, coal and many other natural resources and minerals. Additionally, it is a country that is very well placed strategically due to the access it provides to South-East Asia and beyond, through the Bay of Bengal. All these make it very attractive to the world’s imperialist powers.</p>
<p>As the politics of the country it is dominated by self-interest, corruption, political violence and more importantly lack of vision, commitment and dedication from subsequent leaderships, the country faced rampant corruption and tit-for-tat politics between the two main secular political parties, the Awami League and BNP. The Awami League in both of its terms created rule of godfathers who embroiled the country in crime and terror. It is this very failure of the country’s politics that has endangered the country’s security and its resources, and brought tremendous hardship and oppression upon the people. The people of Bangladesh now live in a state of despair which the country’s dysfunctional politics.</p>
<p><strong>Attempt to crush and ban Jamaat and execute its leaders</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.savebd.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/ICT_image.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-336 alignleft" title="ICT_image" src="http://www.savebd.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/ICT_image.jpg" alt="" width="422" height="221" /></a>Onslaught of systematic brutal fascist actions by the current ultra-secularist government of Bangladesh against the largest organization of Islamic da’wah movement Bangladesh Jamaat e Islami is an attempt to crush and ban Jamaat and execute its leaders. This move is nothing but to remove all political obstacles in the way of the government of Bangladesh Awami League (BAL) to de-Islamize and secularize the country under the framework of the 1972 secularist Constitution that it is committed to restore since the same was subsequently amended in favor of constitutional principles that are suitable to a Muslim nation.<br />
As part of its systematic fascist policy of exterminating the Islamic da’wah the government has unlawfully and unjustifiably arrested the Ameer of Jamaat Mr. Mawlana Motiur Rahman Nizami, Secretary General Mr. Ali Ahsan Mujahid, Deputy Ameer Mr. Mawlana Delawar Hossain Sayeedi on June 29, 2010 followed by a subsequent random arrest of hundreds of other leaders and activists throughout the country by grossly violating all norms of justice, human rights and democracy.</p>
<p>Unless the government’s brutal fascist actions are immediately intervened and abetted, the innocent leaders and workers of Jamaat may be subjected to inhuman tortures and execution on unfounded false and fabricated charges, the country may lose its prestigious Islamic identity and the nation may precipitate into disunity and political unrest leading to a civil war.</p>
<p>It is pertinent to note how politically ill-motivated and baseless the charges are on which the Jamaat leaders, who are highly respected Islamic scholars and personalities, were arrested by the ultra-secularist regime. It sounds completely ‘crocodile tears’ of an ultra-secularist government who does not have slightest sympathy to religious sentiment but to take all advantage thereof for political profiteering to arrest these Islamic leaders and scholars on a frivolous and fabricated allegation of hurting the religious sentiment of the Muslims.</p>
<p>It is needless to state further how politically ill-motivated the arrest was and in what a fascist manner the government acted adhering to a principle of “might is right” since the alleged fabricated statement for which these highly respected Islamic leaders were arrested was not made by any of them but by another Jamaat leader who in fact made a comparison in one of his statements that the challenges and suppressions faced by the Prophet’s movement and those that Jamaat is currently facing are no different.</p>
<p>Any person with rudimentary common sense can conclude that this should not by any means be construed as hurting religious sentiment yet by prominent Islamic leaders and scholars. Nevertheless the ultra-secularist government, which is utterly hostile to Islamic political activities, created a big issue out of this for its mean political gain.</p>
<p>It is further alarming that following the Jamaat leaders’ arrest, all forces of the ultra-secularist fascist government including the police and the country’s specially trained force Rapid Action Battalion or RAB have started a massive arrest and crackdown on Jamaat in every nook and corner of the country at the clear instruction of the Home Minister.</p>
<div id="attachment_335" style="width: 424px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.savebd.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/AntiIslam_BD_2.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-335 " title="Bangladeshi policeman detain an activist from an Islamic group at a protest in Dhaka" src="http://www.savebd.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/AntiIslam_BD_2.jpg" alt="" width="414" height="248" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Bangladeshi policeman detain an activist from an Islamic group at a protest in Dhaka.</p></div>
<p>There are also massive random attack on the activists and offices of Jamaat throughout the country by the student and youth wings of the ruling Awami League party.</p>
<p>It is a matter of further concern that the government also denies any democratic right of Jamaat activists to protest against the politically motivated unjust arrest of their beloved leaders and demand their release.</p>
<p>In the past two years law enforcing agency has refused to permit any protest and demonstration by Jamaat activists. In such situation whenever there is any protest or gathering by Jamaat police is there to arrest and torture the protesting Jamaat men. According to claim by the Home Minster of Bangladesh police has arrested more than 2500 Jamaat activists in the month of October, 2012 alone.</p>
<p>Whenever government apprehended that the court might grant bail to the Jamaat leaders in such a frivolous case, they immediately declared the leaders under custody as &#8220;shown arrested&#8221; under other serious unfounded false cases, so that they could not escape remand and physical torture for which is regime is notoriously known.</p>
<p>As such, while the court has granted them bail for the frivolous case for which they were initially arrested, they are by now shown arrested for 8 cases whereas many more false cases are underway to be concocted against whereby the government has demanded 40 days remand for each of the leaders.</p>
<p><strong>Awami League embraced secularism and fascism as its ideology</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.savebd.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Bangladesh-Police-Brutality.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-245" title="Bangladeshi riot police kick a protestor" src="http://www.savebd.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Bangladesh-Police-Brutality.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="221" /></a>Bangladesh Awami League, the present ruling party of Bangladesh, embraced secularism as its ideology from the beginning of its formation. The development of secularism in Bangladesh, however, started through an abnormal psyche, which is an extreme opposition to, and a deep-rooted desire of annihilating Islam and its symbols.</p>
<p>After taking absolute control of the country in 1971, Awami League banned all Islamic parties and institutions and de-Islamized the educational system. Thousands of Islamic scholars and Islam loving-people were brutally killed only because they supported the unity of the two parts of then Pakistan that was created in the name of Islam out of the Hinduism dominated Indian sub-continent.</p>
<p>However, the situation was changed within a short period of time. After the fall of the Awami League regime by the 1975 revolution, Islamic da’wah movement gradually re-emerged and within few decades, it has been able to establish its strong base in the grassroots level of the society.</p>
<p>After the incident of 9/11, the vitality and dominance of Islamic movement in Bangladesh drew the attention of world superpower and its local agents who are hostile to Islam. As a consequence, in 2007 the democratic process in Bangladesh was halted for two years. During that time, Islamic movement became the prime target of anti-Islamic media propaganda.</p>
<div id="attachment_337" style="width: 395px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.savebd.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/AntiIslam_BD_3.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-337" title="AntiIslam_BD_3" src="http://www.savebd.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/AntiIslam_BD_3.jpg" alt="" width="385" height="270" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Activits of Bangabandhu Kishor Mela demonstrate at Central Shaheed menar in the Dhaka City demanding a quick trial for war crimes allegedly committed by the Pakistan army during Bangladesh&#39;s liberation struggle in 1971.</p></div>
<p>The leaders of Islamic movement were falsely portrayed as ‘war criminals’ in national and international media. Subsequently, the two-year interim unconstitutional government before the current government, backed by military junta and anti-Islamic international community, handed over the power to the Bangladesh Awami League through a forged election employing a digital rigging, whereby the ultra-secularist party secured more than two third seats of the parliament under an engineered election.</p>
<p>After getting the power again, Awami League publicly vowed to exterminate Islamic movement from Bangladesh. As a part of that agenda, they are trying to stage ‘war crime’ tribunal drama. It is obvious that they do not have any evidence to try any leader of Islamic movement. Therefore, they could not try them through ordinary judicial system. They had to revive an Act, namely the Crimes (Tribunal) Act, 1973, which denies basic human rights of the accused.</p>
<p>Under this Act anyone can be prosecuted and convicted without proper evidence or on the basis of false and fabricated evidence. That is why the International Bar Association has already declared this Act as outdated, fraught with injustices and against fundamental human rights. Nevertheless, the Bangladeshi government is adamant in prosecuting the so called ‘war criminals’ through this Act, and accordingly started a massive media campaign against the leaders of Jamaat.</p>
<p>Before even forming the tribunal and appointing the investigators and prosecutors, the ultra-secularist ruling party leaders and their loyal media already included all top Jamaat-e-Islami leaders in the list of ‘war criminals’ and started seriously defaming and defiling the renowned Islamic personalities of the country. Their list even includes some current Islamic movement leaders who were only 4 years old at the time of the war.</p>
<p><strong>Violation of international and domestic laws</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_338" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.savebd.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Toby.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-338" title="Toby" src="http://www.savebd.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Toby-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Toby Cadman, international expert in war crimes laws</p></div>
<p>‘What is going on in Bangladesh is a flagrant violation of international and domestic laws in the name of ‘International War-crime Tribunal’ where some members of the government and the prosecution team have announced when the trial is going to finish, how it is going to finish, and which individuals are going to be executed’- observed Toby Cadman, an international expert in war crimes laws.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in almost every day in the recent times giving statements in media and public appearances declaring ‘execution’ to Islamic personalities presently under trial by so called ‘International War crime Tribunal’. Those rhetoric ‘statements’ are being repeated by her cabinet ministers and party leaders almost every day in the news media.<br />
In almost every public meetings posters and edifies depicting ‘opposition leaders being hanged ‘ is a common scene.</p>
<p>On the other hand statements made by members of the prosecution team indicates that the government has the clear intention to convict and ultimately execute at least three — Prof. Ghulam Azam, Maulana Delwar Hossain Sayeedi and Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury — on or by Dec. 16 of this year when Bangladesh celebrates the anniversary of winning its independence.”</p>
<p>The government of Sheikh Hasina will do everything possible to execute these people because the government is afraid that if they give them long-term prison sentences and if the ruling party then loses the next election, there is a risk that these people will be released by the new government.</p>
<p>This clearly shows that the verdicts have been issued in advance and that if trials continue in this way and verdicts of execution are carried out, the consequences will be grave for the country.</p>
<p>There are clear flaws surrounding the trial as well as the violation of international and domestic laws vis-à-vis the manner in which the trial is being conducted. Even then the Bangladesh government may attempt to convict some of the accused by Dec. 16, the 41st anniversary of the end of the liberation war and the creation of the new state of Bangladesh. Some of the accused are expected to be executed by March 25, 2013, the anniversary of the Pakistan army’s suppression of the insurgency of Awami League supporters led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. That was after Gen. Yahya Khan postponed convening the National Assembly (parliament) following the election in which the Awami League won the majority of seats required to form the federal government.</p>
<p>The rush by the International Crimes Tribunal (ICT), set up by the Bangladesh government, to hold summary trial proceedings and restrict the number of defense witnesses to only 12 in the case of one of the high-profile accused has raised concern. Defense lawyers have also been asked by the Tribunal to provide a list of witnesses. This demand is a fundamental flaw in itself because disclosing the names of defense witnesses to the prosecution will enable them to make changes in the case.</p>
<p>Restricting the number of witnesses to 12 by the Tribunal is an arbitrary act. Looking at the way the judges are now scheduling some of the cases, it is evident that the tribunal is prioritizing time.</p>
<p>In these circumstances those countries that have influence and that have an interest in Bangladesh or countries in which Bangladesh has an interest should now intervene with the Bangladesh government. It should be noted that there was an earlier ruling by the UN Human Rights Council that such trials were arbitrary and lacked international criteria.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.savebd.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/AntiIslam_BD_5.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-340" title="AntiIslam_BD_5" src="http://www.savebd.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/AntiIslam_BD_5.jpg" alt="" width="422" height="450" /></a>United Nations, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, the International Bar Association and other agencies also expressed concern that such courts are in violation of international laws and not up to international legal standards.</p>
<p>They are neither international tribunals nor domestic tribunals. In practice ICT is something ambiguous, if it is an international tribunal, it should have international judges and international prosecutors and should be conducted under international law.</p>
<p>This is not a domestic tribunal either because it excludes domestic rules of procedure and evidence applied in all criminal cases in Bangladesh under the Criminal Evidence Act and the Criminal Procedure Act. Those charged with crimes under the jurisdiction of the tribunal are denied the fundamental freedoms and rights guaranteed by the country’s constitution to all its citizens.</p>
<p>Why the Bangladesh government is so afraid of an international inquiry into the cases if the evidence is strong and substantial? If three million people were killed during the Liberation War in Bangladesh, then it is similar to what happened in Cambodia. There was an international tribunal in Cambodia, and cases like these should not be dealt with by local judiciary.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br />
International and regional anti-Islamic forces and their local agents like the ruling Awami League and its communist allies consider Jamaat as the main obstacle in fulfilling their dream of an ‘Islam free Bangladesh.’ If they can successfully convict the entire leadership of Jamaat, the next step will be banning Islam based political parties and associations. They have already taken steps to de-Islamize the education system which will be easily done if there is no opposition from Jamaat and other socio-political and Islamic organizations.</p>
